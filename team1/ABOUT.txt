* Project Name
United Way Challenge: Data
	Where we are and where we need to be
	
* Main Questions
Is there good data available?
	What/where are resources to be tapped?
	Thinking about crowd-sourcing data gathering
	Thinking about total population hunger, not just kids
What needs to be done to make the data useful?

* Insights
Google is useful, but not free
	2500/day limit for free queries
	10 queries/second limit
	United Way should have Google accounts for use by researchers and volunteers
FIPS codes are useful (thanks, Zeydy)
USGS location data was a great find
Agency programs data needed a lot of work

* Future Work
Add census tract data to locations
Create Python code for github
Ushahidi or similar application for crowd-sourced data gathering
Culinary schools
	Create profitable recipes (thanks Lauren)
	Teach cooking/recipes for those in line (thanks, Lucia)
Work with attendees â€“ ?how?
